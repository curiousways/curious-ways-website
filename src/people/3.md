name: "Pete Lewis"
title: "Design Partner"
bio: "I can't work out if Pete's an artist who makes his living as a designer or a designer with an artistic temperament. Or perhaps he's a philosopher masquerading as a stand-up comic – the kind of post-modern comic that stands to one side of the spotlight and growls out finely wrought aperçus in a slightly fearsome Hull accent. He's almost certainly one of those things."
