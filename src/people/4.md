name: "Simon Wellings"
title: "Creative Partner"
bio: "Simon has been travelling in and out of agencyland for over a hundred years, starting as a media hack at YTV in London,  journeying through strategy and account management, fetching up as a copywriter in Sydney. During a 10-year sabbatical, he walked a few miles in 'client' shoes, launching theatre, TV and tech projects that brought him both triumph and disaster. After 20 years gathering material around the world, he returned to England and agencyland in 2007.  He's built and run two creative departments and one whole agency, and provided strategic and creative direction to global brands and pre-seed start-ups."
