name: "Simon Wellings"
title: "Job Title"
bio: "A most unusual of friendships, although he insists we are colleagues. Our old 4 hour daily car commutes means I spent more time with him than with partners or my children. He has the most brightest well-read minds I have had the chance to encounter. This makes him great for analysing almost anything you throw his way and pulling this into a succinct (and usually correct) point of view; great for when we are at work, and infuriating when we are at the pub."
