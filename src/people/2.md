name: "Ian Fooks"
title: "Experience Partner"
bio: "Fooks might not be technically OCD, but he takes very very great care that everything is in the right place and consistent with everything else around it. Otherwise he won't sit still. And that applies to everything, not just his design work. Somehow, despite this, he manages to be one of the most friendly and generous people you'll ever meet. Terrible poet, though."
