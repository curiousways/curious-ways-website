name: "David Flindall"
title: "Technical Partner"
bio: "David's one of those rare finds: a digital savant who speaks fluent human, with a calm expertise that inspires confidence in colleagues and clients alike. He's an original thinker, culturally avant-garde and intellectually restless. But once he gets into the nuts and bolts of building a website, everything else disappears and he turns into a robot. It's weird."
